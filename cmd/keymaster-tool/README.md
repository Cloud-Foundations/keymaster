# Keymaster-tool

A tool for helper functions around keymaster. As of Oct 2025 it contains only
two commands: generate-key and print-public

## commands

### generate-key

Is purpose is to securely genetate keys for keymaster. That is the private keys
generated by this command only exist in plaintext in memory. The output is a
gpg symmetrically encrypted private key. The encryption passphrase can come
from AWS secrets manager or from the cli (stdin).

It currently only has one parameter which is key type ("rsa" or "ed25519").
For RSA we only generate 3072 bit keys.

###  print-public

Prints the public key from an encrypted file such as the one made by "generate-key".
The outout can be in either PEM or ssh (authorized keys) format.
